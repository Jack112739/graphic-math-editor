Do not modify the requirement to a great extend!!

Specification:
    1: the play-ground with graphs
        v every node will be hightlighted when clicked (event onmousedown)
        v the nodes can be dragged
        v the top of the screen will have the link with style "lemma 1 > lemma 1,1 > lemma 1.1.1"
        v user can click on the link to go back to the higher level proof
        v can create link between nodes
        v external node have different display
        v double click the node will switch to the content inside the node and re-render the screen
        v have all of the options for the nodes resize, rename, edit,... appear when right clicked
        v shortcuts for edit, create node,...
        - hide and show edges
        - undo-redo option
        - have different modes (low priority)
    2: the latex editor
        v automate a link if typed \ref, \cite
        v have a preview
        v autocomplete
        v support other formatting.
        v fix contentEditable weird behavior
        v undo - redo
        v suggesting latex keywords
        v visual editing mode 
        v movable
        v responsive
    3: computer can understand the proof and judges wether it's true or not
        - user can explain their intention with the node further
        - every node is a "simple" mathematical arguement
    4: the website:
        - able to save the proof into a file
        - able to read to proof from a file
        - include 
            + write an introduction into index file
            + playground which is for user playing with the graph functionality
            + a manual document on what this website provide
            + a resource page provide basic fundalmental theorem for mathematic 
            + a problem set for user to solve them online

Aim (sort by priority):
make the graph fully functional
make the editor work

automate linking math argument
vim-like editor
linting for typing latex

make the compiler understand wether the proof is correct or not (at certain degree)
make this a compeptitive website
