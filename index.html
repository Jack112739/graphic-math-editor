    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In the tradditional way of display mathematical proof, we present it in a linearly way and read from line to
      line. This sometime can make that proof harder to go through, especially when it is not well documented since the the relations between proof's arguement is not always linear and it's harder to keep track all the references when the proof is more complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this website we aim to make that mathematical proof become easier to visualize and increase the readablity so that even machines can understand wether the proof is correct or not. To do so we interpret it as a directed acyclic graph where arguements are represented as nodes and the dependencies between them are represented as edges. <br>
