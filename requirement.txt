Do not modify the requirement to a great extend!!

Specification:
    1: the play-ground with graphs
        v every node will be hightlighted when clicked (event onmousedown)
        v the nodes can be dragged
        v the top of the screen will have the link with style "lemma 1 > lemma 1,1 > lemma 1.1.1"
        v user can click on the link to go back to the higher level proof
        v can create link between nodes
        v external node have different display
        v double click the node will switch to the content inside the node and re-render the screen
        v have all of the options for the nodes resize, rename, edit,... appear when right clicked
        v shortcuts for edit, create node,...
        v hide and show edges, remove edges
        v undo-redo option
        - have different modes (low priority)
        - show and hide has different meaning, change the name switch_to to focus
        v update the css-style for nodes
        v label now is optional, instead, show their math-type
        v make node zoomable
    2: the latex editor
        v automate a link if typed \ref, \cite
        v have a preview
        v autocomplete
        v support other formatting.
        v fix contentEditable weird behavior
        v undo - redo
        v suggesting latex keywords
        v visual editing mode 
        v movable
        v responsive
    3: computer can understand the proof and judges wether it's true or not
        v define define new variables / terms
        v lemma is ones that can be reused like functions
        v given is the input
        v result is the output 
        v claim is the default one
        v using reference other
        v reference node will partially apeared
        - add some keywords
        - user can explain their intention with the node further
        - every node is a "simple" mathematical arguement
    4: the website:
        v able to save the proof into a file
        v able to read to proof from a file
        - include 
            ? examples
            v write an introduction into index file
            v playground which is for user playing with the graph functionality
            v a manual document on what this website provide
            + a resource page provide basic fundalmental theorem for mathematic 
            + (low) a problem set for user to solve them online

Aim (sort by priority):
make the graph fully functional
make the editor work

automate linking math argument
linting for typing latex



make the compiler understand wether the proof is correct or not (at certain degree)
make this a compeptitive website
